The Energy Consumption Dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive view of how energy is utilized within the organization. It highlights critical usage trends, compares department-wise consumption, and pinpoints areas with high or irregular usage patterns.

🛠️ Process Workflow

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Raw energy usage data was extracted from the company's internal database. Using Python, the data was cleaned and transformed through preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed in **Python**, the EDA phase included statistical profiling, outlier detection, and early insights generation. Visualization tools such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` were used to better understand consumption behavior.

3. Data Export to Power BI

The final preprocessed dataset was exported in CSV format and imported into Power BI for advanced visualization.

4. Dashboard Development in Power BI

Utilized Power BI’s capabilities to design a dynamic and interactive dashboard:

* Created custom tables, DAX measures, and calculated columns
* Used Power Query Editor for further data transformation
* Implemented slicers and filters for user-driven insights
* Incorporated tooltips and drill-down features for deeper analysis

📊 Dashboard Features
* 📅 Monthly and yearly energy consumption trends**
* 🏢 Department-wise and source-wise usage comparison**
* ⚠️ Anomaly detection and peak usage identification**
* 🔍 Interactive drill-down and filter options**
* 💡 Insights into energy conservation opportunities**


🚀 Impact
The dashboard enabled the organization to:

* Monitor real-time energy consumption
* Make data-informed decisions on energy optimization
* Reduce unnecessary energy costs through targeted interventions.
